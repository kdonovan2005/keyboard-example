Welcome to my example keyboard.

This is a custom keyboard that I made for a client project. I wrote a blog post (you can read it at rubyisshiny.tumblr.com) about creating the keyboard. This is the example code for that blog post.

If you would like more information about me, please visit my personal website at www.kristinydonovan.com. For any questions or comments, please email me.

Thanks!
